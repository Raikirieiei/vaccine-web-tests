## My answer to the question.

### which do you think is a better framework for E2E testing of web applications or web services:  Robot Framework or Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and JUnit? <br />
**Ans**: I think Robot Framework is better in term of visualization, Because we get to see the robot that actually testing the website and know what's happenning in the browser.
